# Chatroom Server Using Simple Reliable UDP
A web message client server model that communicates via a reliable UDP protocol (that is, really, just a shoddier version of TCP.). Client post messages to the server and the server saves it in a .txt file with simple read/write (no modern DBMS either).  This is just an experiment to write my own reliable transport layer.
